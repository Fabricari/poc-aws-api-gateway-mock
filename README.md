# poc-aws-api-gateway-mock

Proof of concept exploring the use of AWS API Gateway mock integrations as a lightweight substitute for backend services during client development.

This repository includes infrastructure provisioning code and minimal supporting assets that demonstrate how API Gateway can be configured to expose predefined HTTP endpoints and responses without invoking Lambda functions or downstream services. The intent is to enable early client integration, contract validation, and API behavior experimentation.

All code is provided as-is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended for production use.
